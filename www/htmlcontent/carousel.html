Adjacent to the main Zoo building is the beautiful carousel. As you approach the animal exhibit areas, you will lured to ride the wonderfully hand-carved painted ponies by the delightful oldtime organ music.

Cafesjian's Carousel was built in 1914 by Philadelphia Toboggan Company. It is known as PTC 33 because it is the 33rd machine they made. The company employed German immigrants to do most of the carving and painting. The word "toboggan" in the company name is an old term for roller-coaster, which was the company's original product.
