<h2>PARKING</h2>

Download Como Map for the location of our parking lots. There are a number of parking lots throughout the Como Regional Park area. 
</p>
<p class="float-none">
But, instead of searching for that elusive parking spot, we would like to encourage you to take the free shuttle. Shuttle service begins weekends April 20- September 29 (with the exception of August 24-25 and August 31-September 2 when there will be no service), and daily service begins June 1 - August 9.  Click on the "Shuttle" tab for more information.

<p class="float-none">
Beginning May 1st residential permit parking restrictions will be in effect.  There will be no parking allowed on many streets west of Como Park from 10am-4pm, May 1-September 30 without a City issued permit.
