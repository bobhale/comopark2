                Como Park’s history dates long before the Como Park Conservatory was constructed.  In the 1840′s, Charles Perry owned, grew potatoes and farmed the land around Lake Como, which at the time was named after Perry’s birthplace in the Swiss-Italian Alps, Sandy Lake.  Eventually Perry moved north. A gentleman by the name of Henry “King of Real Estate Dealers” McKenty, jumped at the opportunity to purchase the land from Perry and renamed it Como Lake after the famous Lake Como in the Italian Alps.
