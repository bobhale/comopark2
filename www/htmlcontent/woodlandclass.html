        <h2>Woodland Classroom</h2>

 <p class="float-none">

See how an ignored, trash strewn, buckthorn infested 

woodland became an outdoor learning area.  A group of local neighbors and St. Paul 

Park and Recreation have worked together to make this amazing transformation 

happen.  The Como Woodland is now a place for you to explore and study, listen to 

birds, see a fox, a white-tailed deer or take a photo of a wildflower in the 

spring. 
</p>
<p class="float-none">Located across Horton Ave from the sports fields and picnic pavilion, the woodland classroom offers a forest within the city. Students and teachers may come and explore simply by making a reservation. See the Maps page for location.
