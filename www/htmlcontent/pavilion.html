<h2>Como Lakeside Pavilion</h2>

<p class="float-none">

Perched on the shore of Lake Como, the pavilion, built in 1905 houses the 

Black Bear Crossings restaurant, an open-air concert hall, canoe and 

paddle boat rental with 1.75 miles of bike/pedestrian trails around the lake. Bike 

rentals are available. </p>

<h2>Lake Como</h2>
<p class="float-none">The lake itself has its origin in the mile high glaciers that covered a large part of the midwest 10,000 years ago. The melt from the snow and ice created Lake Como as well as most other rivers and lakes in the area.</p>
<h2>Fishing</h2>
<p class="float-none">The lake is stocked with several species of fish including pike and catfish.
On the south shore there is a floating fishing pier where you can try your luck. </p>
